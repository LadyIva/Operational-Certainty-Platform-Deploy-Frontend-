### Key Takeaways:

1.  **`node_modules/`:** This is the local folder where `npm` or `yarn` installs all your dependencies. It is massive and must never be committed to Git.
2.  **`dist/`:** This is the folder that the **Netlify build process creates**. It contains the optimized, ready-to-deploy static files. Since Netlify creates it, you shouldn't commit it.
3.  **Python files:** You can remove any Python-specific entries (like `__pycache__` or `*.pyc`) that might have accidentally carried over from your backend development, as they are not relevant to this frontend repository.

Once you have this file in your new frontend folder, run your `git add .` and `git commit` commands, and you will be ready for a clean push to your new GitHub repository!
